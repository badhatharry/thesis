neutron star crust and the liquid core, is calculated. It is based on
the effective nuclear interaction SLy of the Skyrme type, which is
particularly suitable for the application to the calculation of the
properties of very neutron rich matter (Chabanat et al. 1997, 1998). The
structure of the crust, and its EOS, is calculated in the T=0
approximation, and under the assumption of the ground state composition.
The crust-core transition is a very weakly first-order phase transition,
with relative density jump of about one percent. The EOS of the liquid
core is calculated assuming (minimal) npemu composition. Parameters of
static neutron stars are calculated and compared with existing
observational data on neutron stars. The minimum and maximum masses of
static neutron stars are 0.094 M$_{sun}$ and 2.05 M$_{sun}$,
respectively. Effects of rotation on the minimum and the maximum mass of
neutron stars are briefly discussed.

complicated kinds of short-range order, the dimensionality should be

dependence on nuclear models discussed.

  abstract = {The appearance of quark phases in the dense interior of neutron stars
provides one possibility to soften the equation of state (EOS) of
neutron star matter at high densities. This softening leads to more
compact equilibrium configurations of neutron stars compared to pure
hadronic stars of the same mass. We investigate the question to which
amount the compactness of a neutron star can be attributed to the
presence of a quark phase. For this purpose we employ several hadronic
EOS in the framework of the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model and an
extended MIT bag model to describe the quark phase. We find that -
almost independent of the model parameters - the radius of a pure
hadronic neutron star gets typically reduced by 20-30\% if a pure quark
phase in the center of the star does exist. For some EOS we furthermore
find the possibility of a third family of compact stars which may exist
besides the two known families of white dwarfs and neutron stars. We
show how an experimental proof of the existence of a third family by
mass and radius measurements may provide a unique signature for a phase
transition inside neutron stars.

  abstract = {The work of J. A. Wheeler in the mid 1960's showed that for smooth
equations of state no stable stellar configurations with central
densities above that corresponding to the limiting mass of `neutron
stars' (in the generic sense including hybrids) were stable.
Accordingly, there has been no reason to expect that a stable degenerate
family of stars with higher density than the known white dwarfs and
neutron stars might exist. Nevertheless, we have found a class of
equations of state that describe a first order phase transition and are
insufficiently smooth to obey the conditional theorem of Wheeler. We
identify the attributes that give rise to a third family of stable dense
stars, discuss how such a higher density family of stars could be formed
in nature, and how the promising new exploration of oscillations in the
X-ray brightness of accreting neutron stars might provide a means of
identifying them.
